## Most-Threatened Heuristic

## Speed

In general, `brute_force` < `backtracking` < `lookahead` < `heuristic`. Results on my machine are tabulated below.

## Convergence

Provided there exists a solution for the given board size, the fact that the brute-force, backtracking, and lookahead solvers will converge on a solution is easy to show. They explore all possible placements until a solution is found, skipping over only invalid solutions. That the heuristic solver will converge, however, is a bit more interesting to think about.

Because the solver always moves one of the most-threatened queens first, could there exist an infinte loop wherein some subset of threatened queens are continually moved, bringing about live-lock behavior? Certainly such an event could occur if the same queen was always selected for re-placement.

## Usage
Use of `pypy3` is recommended, but the executable `python3` works, as well.
```
pypy3 solvers.py chess_board_size [ [solution_generation_method] ...]
```
